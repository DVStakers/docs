### 🚀 About Us

We are Eridian and Spacesider, long-time cryptocurrency enthusiasts and experienced Ethereum solo stakers. Together, we write and maintain the [EthStaker Knowledge Base](https://ethstaker.gitbook.io/ethstaker-knowledge-base/), providing an unbiased, open-source collection of useful information and concepts about Ethereum staking.

Our passion for blockchain technology and decentralized systems led us to join forces and explore the exciting world of DVT. Our mission is to contribute to the Ethereum ecosystem by running a secure and efficient DVT setup while engaging with the staking community and sharing our knowledge.
