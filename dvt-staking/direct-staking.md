Direct staking with DVStakers is currently being tested with our existing validators to develop a robust DVT process.

Testing is being conducted on Goerli using both Obol and SSV DVT solutions as neither is currently live on mainnet.

Details on how the infrastructure for these validators are configured can be found here:
