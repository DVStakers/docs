# ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡ª Kenya Node - Phase 2

In [Kenya Node - Phase 1](kenya-node.md) an Ethereum full node, validator, and DVT validators were set up in an office in Nairobi, Kenya ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡ª

Phase 2 was pitched on a Lido Node Operator Community Call and a [grant proposal](https://research.lido.fi/t/dvstakers-grant-proposal/5346) was submitted to Lido LEGO requesting funds for this project.

With the [funds awarded](https://research.lido.fi/t/dvstakers-grant-proposal/5346/4) by Lido LEGO in October 2023, phase 2 could begin!

## Phase 2 Goal

**To set up a fully off-the-grid Ethereum validator in a rural village in Kenya, supporting the local community through education.**

## Preparation

The location chosen for the machines was a house located near the base of Kilimanjaro in Western Kenya. As the home of a local community leader of the Massai tribe, it was an ideal choice for setting up the infrastructure and equipment.

Before DVStakers traveled to Kenya to move the existing equipment from Nairobi a number of preparation steps were required:

1. Solar panels
2. Batteries
3. Starlink Internet
4. Site Security

All the equipment used at the property (excluding the staking machines and laptops) were locally sourced.&#x20;

### Solar Panels

While some electricity is available at the property through the mains powerline, this power is intermittent, and regular power cuts lasting a few hours to a few days are common. The solar panels provide a cheap, clean source of power for the machines and power for the family in their home. The panels were installed at the property by local engineers.

### Batteries

Having reliable solar power is a great start, but the staking machines need to be online 24-7 so power storage was needed. Batteries were installed inside the property to provide consistent power at night and during less sunny periods.

### Starlink Internet

Kenya has a very good mobile internet network that is widely available and reasonably priced. However, for the amount of data needed for an Ethereum full node, faster internet was required. Starlink became active in Kenya in[ July 2023](https://twitter.com/Starlink/status/1681287681341542400), so the timing was perfect for this project!

A concern about using Starlink is the high latency which can have a significant negative impact when running validator nodes, particularly DVT nodes. But latency isn't a "fix" value and changes due to a number of factors including the number of available satellites, weather, ages of satellites, etc.

This screenshot shows a snapshot of a speed test conducted when Starlink was installed. The plan is to continually monitor the speed and latency to see how it changes over time.

### Site Security

With the addition of solar panels and Starlink to the property, consideration was given to the security of the site. While the area is generally very safe, improving the security by upgrading the fence provided protection from both people and animals. It's not uncommon for elephants in the area to break through weak fences and damage properties!

## Setup

The equipment was moved from Nairobi by car to its new location, a drive of around 4 hours. A dedicated room was available for the equipment which also housed the batteries and solar converter.

One of the staking machines required a reinstallation of Linux, so it was a perfect opportunity to give a demonstration for the family showing them what's running on the machines.

The two laptops are used to provide access to the staking machines, local monitoring and are also used by the family and local community school for learning and lesson planning.

The setup contains:

* Starlink
* Homenode (full node)
* Homenode (mini-node)
* Dappnode

TODO:

* Explain more about the setup



## Challenges

### Physical

One of the main physical challenges with this project was transport and access to the site. While many of the main roads in Kenya are paved, access to the smaller villages, particularly during the rainy season can be difficult. Once everything was set up, remote access to the machines meant that direct access to the site wasn't needed every day, which was helpful as a number of days the road became impassable.
