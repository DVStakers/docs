### Step 1: Standard Solo Staking

Standard solo staking on Ethereum today. Isolated solo stakers running all their own equipment. This is the ideal staking setup, on a protocol designed to not harshly punish downtime.&#x20;

The DVT solutions described in the subsequent steps are additive to this first step. If at any point DVT stopped working, a participant decided to stop or the Cloud Auxiliary Client provider shut down, this first step will always be the backup.

### Step 2: Redundant Local Hardware

Still isolated systems, but the single points of failure have been reduced, though not eliminated... yet! This also improves client diversity as different EC/BN pairs can be used.

### Step 3: Redundant Remote Beacon Nodes (Prod - Here todayüìç)

Connect Beacon Nodes to another solo staker to increase redundancy. Further increasing client diversity by running four different EC/BN pairs.

### Step 4: Obol DVT Validators (Dev - Here todayüìç)

By splitting the keys of any existing validators into 9 keyshares each, a 6/9 Obol DVT cluster can be created. This means, that if any one system goes offline (e.g. due to power cuts, natural disaster, or the Cloud provider deciding that supporting the future of [decentralized finance isn't for them...](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/08/26/ethereum-could-get-kicked-off-cloud-host-that-powers-10-of-crypto-network/)) the validators will continue to attest. True DVT!

The Cloud Auxiliary Client is useful in this setup because:

1. There are only two stakers so there needs to be a split of keyshares that doesn't allow for a slashing event. If the keys were split 3/6 with each staker holding half the keys, then if the connection between their Charon nodes dropped out, they would still both be able to perform their duties at the same time (a slashable offense!).
2. It should reduce latency. The idea is that it should be faster for the two home staker nodes to talk to the Cloud provider (if the Cloud node is physically located between the two of them) than it is to talk directly. This should mean better performance for the validators, better inclusion distances, and overall better effectiveness.
3. It shouldn't cost much. Since the bulk of the cost of a validator is running the EC and BN clients, the actual validator clients are very lightweight. This means the Cloud node can be run on minimal hardware, significantly reducing cost.
4. It doesn't remove any sovereignty or require any trust assumptions by using the Cloud provider. If the Cloud provider goes out of business or decides to turn off the node, the two remaining nodes can function perfectly fine. Also, as the Cloud provider only has 3/9 keys, it is not a security risk, as 3 keys can't be used for anything if the signature threshold is 6/9.

### Step 5: StakeWise V3 Vaults + Obol DVT Validators

Adding StakeWise V3 Vaults as an additional Obol DVT Cluster on existing hardware.

This is where the DVT puzzle pieces begin to form a bigger picture. Once this node configuration has been created, additional staking protocols can easily be added to the same hardware. In this step, we're starting with StakeWise V3 Vaults.
