[Proxmox ](https://www.proxmox.com/en/proxmox-ve)has been deployed as a hypervisor where multiple virtual machines are being managed, all of which are running [Ubuntu Server](https://ubuntu.com/download/server) where they serve a specific purpose.

One hosts the Lighthouse vaildator client, one hosts Lighthouse(Consensus)-Nethermind(Execution) and the other hosts Teku(Consensus)-Besu(Execution).

The 4th SSD is a spare which is plugged in ready to go at all times.
