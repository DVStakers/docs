# ‚ùî FAQ

### What is DVT?

Distributed Validator Technology. In a traditional solo staking setup, if a single validator node goes offline due to technical issues or maintenance, it immediately stops performing its validator duties (attestations, block proposals, etc.). This can lead to missed rewards and penalties for the staker.

However, with Distributed Validator Technology (DVT), a group of stakers work together as a single unit. If one of the stakers within the group experiences node downtime, the remaining stakers in the group continue to perform the validator duties collectively. This ensures that the staking process remains uninterrupted, maintaining network stability and allowing the group to continue earning rewards while minimizing the risks associated with individual node failures.

### What is the purpose of DVStakers?

The journey of two Ethereum stakers from solo staking to distributed validator staking.

### **Are you sponsored or paid by anyone?**

No. Currently, this is a side project that we're working on together. If at some point in the future, we do apply for grants or funding to support this project, we'll let you know here.

### Wen Ethereum mainnet?

While Obol DVT isn't ready for Ethereum mainnet yet, we are aiming to be ready when it launches.

### Can I be involved in this project?

If you are an Ethereum solo staker who is interested in being part of the DVT revolution then yes, please join us!&#x20;
