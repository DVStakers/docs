# ‚ùî FAQ

### What is DVT?

Distributed Validator Technology. In a traditional solo staking setup, if a single validator node goes offline due to technical issues or maintenance, it immediately stops performing its validator duties (attestations, block proposals, etc.). This can lead to missed rewards and penalties for the staker.

However, with Distributed Validator Technology (DVT), a group of stakers work together as a single unit. If one of the stakers within the group experiences node downtime, the remaining stakers in the group continue to perform the validator duties collectively. This ensures that the staking process remains uninterrupted, maintaining network stability and allowing the group to continue earning rewards while minimizing the risks associated with individual node failures.

### What is the purpose of DVStakers?

DVStakers is a growing global network of solo stakers, running Ethereum nodes and DVT validators. We provide educational resources and support to anyone interested in learning more about DVT.

### **Are you sponsored or paid by anyone?**

Yes. DVStakers received a grant from the [Ethereum Foundation](https://ethereum.org/) in 2023. This money was used to fund content creation as well as the Kenya node project. More details about the EF grant will be shared when the Q3 2023 Allocation Update blog post is published.

[Lido](https://lido.fi) awarded DVStakers a grant of $25,000 USD to support the work we do and the content we create. The details of that grant can be seen [here](https://research.lido.fi/t/dvstakers-grant-proposal/5346). This was a no-strings-attached grant and DVStakers remains in control of our content and views.

DVStakers thanks everyone who supports the project both with monetary contributions as well as time commitments üôè
